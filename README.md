Let's experiment with discrete time signals! This is a simple code in Python that aims to study and experiment with discrete time signals.

# Getting started
You can get started by creating a virtual environment with the required packages:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will then be able to run the sample codes found in folder `src`.
